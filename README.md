# Welcome to my GitHub!
Fuelled by the forces of commitment, hard work and passion, I spend every day improving my skills and preparing myself for everything the future has planned for me. I work smart, and this is reflected in my career achievements. My drive to excel at everything I do has enabled me to perform at peak efficiency, delivering quality work within the given timeframe.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree (BSc) in Statistics at the prestigious Loyola College, Chennai. Alongside this, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree (BS) in Data Science and Applications offered by the world-renowned Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM). I aspire to pursue my Master's in Actuarial Sciences in a world-renowned college, affiliated with the IFoA.

I found a calling in the field of Actuarial Sciences. I wish to become a member of the IFoA and develop my skills as a Fellow Actuary in the field. Moreover, I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence and its applications and am looking forward to building a tech empire on these innovative technologies.

If you find my projects helpful or interesting, I'll be really happy!
